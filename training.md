GitHub offers classes of increasing skill level that introduce, instruct, and inspire Git and GitHub users to leverage every feature of the platform. If you are new to version control, Git, or collaboration workflows, the Foundations class is a great place to begin. If you have a working knowledge of Git but want to expand your understanding of the technology, try the Intermediate class. If you've used Git and GitHub for several months and want to explore its full potential, consider joining the Advanced class.
